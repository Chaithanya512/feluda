# Endpoint

Every endpoint needs to define a Controller, Handler and Model.

Interface Definition

Controller:

- get_routes
- get_handler

Handler:

- make_handlers: map a API request path to a function

Model:

- dataclasses that model API requests and document them. The purpose models serve is document API paramters and provide code completion.
