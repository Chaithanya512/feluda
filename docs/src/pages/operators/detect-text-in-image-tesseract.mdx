## Documentation for Tesseract OCR Operator

For each language support, we need to install separate tesseract operators for each language. Right now the current operator only supports English and Hindi languages. 

For Linux, you can follow these links to understand how and what modules to install for each language.

To extract text from an image, we pass the image through a tesseract function like this

```
data = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='eng+hin', config='--psm 6 --oem 1')
```

Here the config settings help us define some more insight into the image and LSTM blocks for the image extraction engines. 

You can take a look at the operator and the test of the operator for the entire code.
