# Search

A configurable multimedia and multi modal search engine.
This forms the core of our search services. Since different use cases might require different search capabilities with different trade offs, Tattle Search lets you specify which building blocks you want to use for the purpose and spins a search engine with a corresponding configuration.

## Features
- Support for Vector based embeddings using ResNet models and Sentence Transformers
- Support for hash based search using pHash
